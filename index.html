            <p>
                Standing here, I realize you were
                Just like me trying to make history.
                But who's to judge the right from wrong.
                When our guard is down I think we'll both agree.
                That violence breeds violence.
                But in the end it has to be this way.

                And they run when the sun comes up
                With their lives on the line (alive)
                For all that I've (no choice)
                Gotta follow the laws of the wild (alive)
                With their lives on the line (no choice)
                Out here only the strong survive
